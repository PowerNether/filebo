        <p class="text">
            At FileBo Team, we respect your privacy and believe that the less we know about you, 
            the better both for you and for us. In fact, we do not collect any personal 
            data through FileBo unless you voluntarily provide it to us (e.g., by sending a support email or subscribing to a newsletter). 
            We limit the information we collect to the minimum necessary to provide you with our service and improve FileBo. 
            Our business is developing and selling software, not your personal data.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Below, we've provided detailed information on when and why we collect your personal data and how we use it.
